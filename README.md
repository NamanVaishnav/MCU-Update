# Marvel’s comic characters App

Objectives to Achive
---------------------------- 

* App shows a list of Marvel characters. Clicking on each character will show details of the character.
* App should work in offline mode. This means that the app should cache data in the local storage and load the list from the local storage and update the storage simultaneously from the API.
* Each character can be bookmarked. API does not have bookmark information so this will be a local only feature. Use the local storage to preserve bookmark information so API sync should not override the bookmark flag.
* Pull down to refresh functionality on the list. It should always refresh data from the API.
